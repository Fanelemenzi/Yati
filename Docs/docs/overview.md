## **Yati Architecture Overview**
### **Key Codebases**
The main Yati codebase is at [https://github.com/Fanelemenzi/Yati](). Iit contains all the frontend and backend code for the Yati Mobile App.

Yati Mobile app is a mobile app built on with the flutter framework supporting both iOS and Andriod written with Python and HTML to support some app functions.

### **Usage Assumptions and Concepts**
Yati is a information application provide answers to questions about services and products provided by the Eswatini Government. Information is structured in form of FAQs with answers. It is divided by deaprtments with each department getting its own set of questions and answers.

### **Architecture Components** 

### **Flutter and APIs**
Yati's is primarily implemented in the Flutter cross platform framework with APIs calling data stored on a codebase.

Flutter with dart provides the UI of the application and backend logic allowing/providing functionality to the application UI. The API provide the backend functionality by getting data from database.


## **Directory Structure**
This page documents the Yati directory structure, where to find things, and how to decide where to put a file.

### **Core Folders and Files**
Yati uses the Flutter crossplartform framework, some of this path are default packages and folders coming with the flutter framework.
Folders and Files that can be changed are the working part of the project are expanded and explains in great detail further down this section. These are [lib], [Docs], [pubspec.yaml].

* `yati/.dart_tool` - This folder comes with dart version 2 and used by pub and other tools. It replaced the .pub directory.
* `yati/andriod` - This folder contains native andriod code. Most of the time you dont need to change anything inside this folder but of you want to intercat with low level functions (eg. camera, bluetooth, gps) you need to edit this folder.
* `yati/assets` - This folder contains assests used throughout the project such images, videos, icons and more
* `yati/Docs` - this is the documentation folder that contains all the files dealing with the documentation of any changes in the development of the Yati app.
* `yati/ios` - this folder contains native iOS code.
* `yati/lib` - This is the folder where we will be mostly hanging around in because we will write our Flutter code into this folder. By default lib folder contians only the `main.dart` file. The `main.dart` file is like the a car ignition becuase the app starts running from the `main.dart` file. The folder structure inside lib is important for organizing and managing the application.
* `yati/linux` - Same as andriod folder, contians native code to run application on Linux software 
* `yati/macos` - Folder contains native code torun software on MacOS operating systems.
* `yati/test` - This is the folder where we will write our test for the application.
* `yati/web` - This folder contains code to run the application on web browsers
* `yati/windows` - This folder contains native code that allows app to run on windows OS.
* `yati/.readthedocs.yaml` - file that allows for the app documentation to be hosted on ReadTheDocs.
* `yati/.analysis_options/yaml` - This is a file configuration which configures Dart analyzer which checks all your code and if your code has any conflict with the configurations you wrote then IDE gives an error or warning.
* `yati/pubspec.lock` - This file contains all the packages versions, dependency and description informations used in the project. Purpose is to keep the app packages locked in the same library version so if wwe run the app in different computers we dont have to struggle with code issue caused from different package versions.
* `yati/pubspec.yaml` - This file controls app name, SDK version, packages, dependencies and assets. If you want to add new packages to your project you need to add the package name under dependencies section. 
* `yati/READMe.md` - This is the default markdown file containing resources to get started into Flutter for beginners.
