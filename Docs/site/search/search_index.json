You can view this glossary by running man gitglossary. Below we\u2019ve included the Git terms you\u2019ll encounter most often along with their definitions from gitglossary.</p> <p>branch A \u201cbranch\u201d is an active line of development. The most recent commit on a branch is referred to as the tip of that branch. The tip of the branch is referenced by a branch head, which moves forward as additional development is done on the branch. A single Git repository can track an arbitrary number of branches, but your working tree is associated with just one of them (the \u201ccurrent\u201d or \u201cchecked out\u201d branch), and HEAD points to that branch.</p> <p>cache Obsolete for: index</p> <p>checkout The action of updating all or part of the working tree with a tree object or blob from the object database, and updating the index and HEAD if the whole working tree has been pointed at a new branch.</p> <p>commit As a noun: A single point in the Git history; the entire history of a project is represented as a set of interrelated commits. The word \u201ccommit\u201d is often used by Git in the same places other revision control systems use the words \u201crevision\u201d or \u201cversion\u201d. Also used as a short hand for commit object.</p> <p>As a verb: The action of storing a new snapshot of the project\u2019s state in the Git history, by creating a new commit representing the current state of the index and advancing HEAD to point at the new</p> <p>fast-forward A fast-forward is a special type of merge where you have a revision and you are \u201cmerging\u201d another branch\u2019s changes that happen to be a descendant of what you have. In such these cases, you do not make a new merge commit but instead just update to their revision. This will happen frequently on a remote-tracking branch of a remote repository.</p> <p>fetch Fetching a branch means to get the branch\u2019s head ref from a remote repository, to find out which objects are missing from the local object database, and to get them, too. See also git-fetch(1)</p> <p>hash In Git\u2019s context, synonym for object name.</p> <p>head A named reference to the commit at the tip of a branch. Heads are stored in a file in $GIT_DIR/refs/heads/ directory, except when using packed refs. See also git-pack-refs(1).</p> <p>HEAD The current branch. In more detail: Your working tree is normally derived from the state of the tree referred to by HEAD. HEAD is a reference to one of the heads in your repository, except when using a detached HEAD, in which case it directly references an arbitrary commit.</p> <p>index A collection of files with stat information, whose contents are stored as objects. The index is a stored version of your working tree. Truth be told, it can also contain a second, and even a third version of a working tree, which are used when merging.</p> <p>pull Pulling a branch means to fetch it and merge it. See also git-pull(1)</p> <p>push Pushing a branch means to get the branch\u2019s head ref from a remote repository, find out if it is a direct ancestor to the branch\u2019s local head ref, and in that case, putting all objects, which are reachable from the local head ref, and which are missing from the remote repository, into the remote object database, and updating the remote head ref. If the remote head is not an ancestor to the local head, the push fails.</p> <p>rebase To reapply a series of changes from a branch to a different base, and reset the head of that branch to the result.</p>"},{"location":"gitguide/#get-yati-code","title":"Get Yati Code","text":"<p>Yati uses a forked-repo and rebase-oriented workflow.

You\u2019ll know you\u2019re creating a merge commit if you\u2019re prompted for a commit message and the default is something like this:</p> <pre><code>Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/yati\n\n# Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,\n# especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.\n#\n# Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts\n# the commit.\n</code></pre> <p>And the first entry for git log will show something like:</p> <pre><code>commit e5f8211a565a5a5448b93e98ed56415255546f94\nMerge: 13bea0e e0c10ed\nAuthor: Christie Koehler &lt;ck@christi3k.net&gt;\nDate:   Mon Oct 10 13:25:51 2016 -0700\n\n    Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/yati\n</code></pre> <p>Some graphical Git clients may also create merge commits. To undo a merge commit, first run git reflog to identify the commit you want to roll back to:</p> <pre><code>git reflog\n\ne5f8211 HEAD@{0}: pull upstream main: Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.\n13bea0e HEAD@{1}: commit: test commit for docs.\n\n</code></pre> <p>Reflog output will be long. The most recent Git refs will be listed at the top. In the example above <code>e5f8211 HEAD@{0}</code>: is the merge commit made automatically by <code>git pull</code> and <code>13bea0e HEAD@{1}:</code> is the last commit I made before running <code>git pull</code>, the commit that I want to rollback to.</p> <p>Once you\u2019d identified the ref you want to revert to, you can do so with git reset:</p> <pre><code>git reset --hard 13bea0e\nHEAD is now at 13bea0e test commit for docs.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"gitguide/#restore-a-lost-commit","title":"Restore a lost commit","text":"<p>We\u2019ve mentioned you can use <code>git reset --hard</code> to rollback to a previous commit. What if you run <code>git reset --hard</code> and then realize you actually need one or more of the commits you just discarded? No problem, you can restore them with <code>git cherry-pick</code> (docs).</p> <p>For example, let\u2019s say you just committed \u201csome work\u201d and your <code>git log</code> looks like this:</p> <pre><code>* 67aea58 (HEAD -&gt; main) some work\n* 13bea0e test commit for docs.\n</code></pre> <p>You then mistakenly run <code>git reset --hard 13bea0e</code>:</p> <pre><code>git reset --hard 13bea0e\nHEAD is now at 13bea0e test commit for docs.\n\ngit log\n* 13bea0e (HEAD -&gt; main) test commit for docs.\n</code></pre> <p>And then realize you actually needed to keep commit 67aea58. First, use git reflog to confirm that commit you want to restore and then run git cherry-pick : <pre><code>git reflog\n13bea0e HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to 13bea0e\n67aea58 HEAD@{1}: commit: some work\n\ngit cherry-pick 67aea58\n [main 67aea58] some work\n Date: Thu Oct 13 11:51:19 2016 -0700\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 test4.txt\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"gitguide2/","title":"Pull Requests","text":""},{"location":"gitguide2/#create-a-pull-request","title":"Create a pull request","text":"<p>When you\u2019re ready for feedback, submit a pull request. Pull requests are a feature specific to GitHub. They provide a simple, web-based way to submit your work (often called \u201cpatches\u201d) to a project. It\u2019s called a pull request because you\u2019re asking the project to pull changes from your fork.</p> <p>If you\u2019re unfamiliar with how to create a pull request, you can check out GitHub\u2019s documentation on creating a pull request from a fork. You might also find GitHub\u2019s article about pull requests helpful. That all said, the tutorial below will walk you through the process.</p>"},{"location":"gitguide2/#draft-pull-requests","title":"Draft pull requests","text":"<p>In the Zulip project, we encourage submitting draft pull requests early and often. This allows you to share your code to make it easier to get feedback and help with your changes, even if you don\u2019t think your pull request is ready to be merged (e.g., it might not work or pass tests). This sets expectations correctly for any feedback from other developers, and prevents your work from being merged before you\u2019re confident in it.</p>"},{"location":"gitguide2/#create-a-pull-request_1","title":"Create a pull request","text":"<p>Step 0: Make sure you\u2019re on a feature branch (not <code>main</code>) It is important to work on a feature branch when creating a pull request. Your new pull request will be inextricably linked with your branch while it is open, so you will need to reserve your branch only for changes related to your issue, and avoid introducing extraneous changes for other issues or from upstream.</p> <p>If you are working on a branch named <code>main</code>, you need to create and switch to a feature branch before proceeding.</p> <p>Step 1: Update your branch with git rebase The best way to update your branch is with <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git rebase</code>. Do not use <code>git pull</code> or <code>git merge</code> as this will create merge commits. See keep your fork up to date for details.</p> <p>Here\u2019s an example (you would replace issue-123 with the name of your feature branch):</p> <pre><code>git checkout issue-123\nSwitched to branch 'issue-123'\n\ngit fetch upstream\nremote: Counting objects: 69, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (23/23), done.\nremote: Total 69 (delta 49), reused 39 (delta 39), pack-reused 7\nUnpacking objects: 100% (69/69), done.\nFrom https://github.com/zulip/zulip\n   69fa600..43e21f6  main     -&gt; upstream/main\n\ngit rebase upstream/main\n\nFirst, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...\nApplying: troubleshooting tip about provisioning\n</code></pre> <p>Step 2: Push your updated branch to your remote fork</p> <p>Once you\u2019ve updated your local feature branch, push the changes to GitHub:</p> <pre><code>git push origin issue-123\nCounting objects: 6, done.\nDelta compression using up to 4 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (6/6), 658 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.\nTotal 6 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (3/3), completed with 1 local objects.\nTo git@github.com:christi3k/zulip.git\n + 2d49e2d...bfb2433 issue-123 -&gt; issue-123\n</code></pre> <p>If your push is rejected with error failed to push some refs then you need to prefix the name of your branch with a +:</p> <pre><code>git push origin +issue-123\nCounting objects: 6, done.\nDelta compression using up to 4 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (6/6), 658 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.\nTotal 6 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (3/3), completed with 1 local objects.\nTo git@github.com:christi3k/zulip.git\n + 2d49e2d...bfb2433 issue-123 -&gt; issue-123 (forced update)\n</code></pre> <p>This is perfectly okay to do on your own feature branches, especially if you\u2019re the only one making changes to the branch. If others are working along with you, they might run into complications when they retrieve your changes because anyone who has based their changes off a branch you rebase will have to do a complicated rebase.</p> <p>Step 3: Open the pull request If you\u2019ve never created a pull request or need a refresher, take a look at GitHub\u2019s article on creating a pull request from a fork. We\u2019ll briefly review the process here.</p> <p>First, sign in to GitHub on your web browser and navigate to your fork of Zulip.</p> <p>Next, navigate to the branch you\u2019ve been working on. Do this by clicking on the Branch button and selecting the relevant branch. Finally, click the New pull request button. Alternatively, if you\u2019ve recently pushed the relevant branch to your fork, you will see a Compare &amp; pull request button.</p> <p>A pull request template will open with some information pre-filled in. Provide (or update) the title for your pull request and write a first comment.</p> <p>If your pull request makes UI changes, always include one or more still screenshots to demonstrate your changes. If it seems helpful, add a screen capture of the new functionality as well. You can find a list of tools you can use for this here.</p> <p>See the documentation for creating reviewable pull requests for more guidance and tips when writing pull request comments. If the repository has a self-review checklist in the pull request template, make sure that all the relevant points have been addressed before submitting it.</p> <p>When ready, click the Create pull request button to submit the pull request. Remember to mark your pull request as a draft if it is a work-in-progress.</p> <p>Note: Pull request titles are different from commit messages. Commit messages can be edited with <code>git commit --amend, git rebase -i</code>, etc., while the title of a pull request can only be edited via GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"gitguide2/#update-a-pull-request","title":"Update a pull request","text":"<p>As you get make progress on your feature or bugfix, your pull request, once submitted, will be updated each time you push commits to your remote branch. This means you can keep your pull request open as long as you need, rather than closing and opening new ones for the same feature or bugfix.</p> <p>It\u2019s a good idea to keep your pull request mergeable with Zulip upstream by frequently fetching, rebasing, and pushing changes. See keep your fork up to date for details. You might also find this excellent article How to Rebase a Pull Request helpful.</p> <p>And, as you address review comments others have made, we recommend posting a follow-up comment in which you: a) ask for any clarifications you need, b) explain to the reviewer how you solved any problems they mentioned, and c) ask for another review.</p>"},{"location":"overview/","title":"Yati Overview","text":"<p>Yati is mobile application built using the Flutter Framework.
